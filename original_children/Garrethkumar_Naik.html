                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Garrethkumar Naik is seven years old and in 3rd grade in a village primary school. He lives with his parents and sister in a small mud house in Kalahandi district. He likes to play around the village with his friends in the evening and his favorite game is hide and seek. He would like to become a school teacher after his schooling over. He is very active in playing and study also. Garreth’s father is a poor farmer and the income from the land is not sufficient to meet the basic needs of the family. So his father works hard in other farmer’s fields and often goes to other states to work so as to earn enough to meet the needs of the family. His village has no clean drinking water or sanitation, so the children suffer from many diseases due to poor hygiene. Through our program, his parents will be helped to undertake various income generation activities such as cash crop cultivation and vegetable marketing program. These will increase the family income and enable them to cover their needs especially those related to child well-being. They will benefit from various training on child rights, water and sanitation. The program will also deal with early childhood development related activities such as training and strengthening community health workers, monitoring community child development committees, organizing exposure visits, character and leadership development program through games, sports, drama, and dances, to develop leadership skills and competencies from early childhood.</p>
