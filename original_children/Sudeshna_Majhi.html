                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Sudeshna Majhi is a very social girl. She regularly attends an early childhood centre in her village in Kalahandi district. She belongs to a poor family living in a small thatched house. In her free time she likes to play kabaddi and running races with her friends. Her favorite food is rice and fish and she would like to become a teacher when she grows up.</p>
                                <p>Sudeshna Majhiâ€™s parent live on a small plot of land where they grow rice and maize seasonally. The production from their land is not sufficient to feed the family. So they work on construction sites to get some income and manage the family. They also depend on forest produce. Her village has no clean drinking water and electricity resulting in health problems like diarrhea, jaundice and malaria.</p>
                                <p>Through our program, her parents will be supported with different types of agricultural training in how to improve production. They will be supplied cash crop seeds to improve their immediate income and futher will be provided seeds, fertilizers, and agriculture equipment to increase their permanent income. She will be encouraged to be part of a child leadership team in the village where she will be taught character and leadership development.</p>
