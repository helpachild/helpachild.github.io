                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Dusmanta Majhi is aged five years and regularly attending the early childhood centre in his village. He lives with his parents and sister in a small thatched room. He is a shy boy and doesn’t talk much. He likes his family very much and wants to play with his friends. His favorite food is egg and likes to eat rice with dal.</p>
                                <p>Dusmanta’s father is a seasonal farmer and his mother is a housewife. His father has no regular income and the family lives with much hardships. Dusmanta’s family has difficulty in agricultural production due to ignorance and proper methods of cultivation. His parents work together to sustain their family through the hard times and often face several issues like food shortage and lack of access to medical care.</p>
                                <p>Dusmanta’s parents will be helped with income generating programs to become a member of a farmers group which will help them through training in cash crop production and business skills so that they become self-sufficient. He and his sister will join a children’s group where they will develop their skills through games, sports and other activities.</p>
