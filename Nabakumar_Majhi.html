                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Nabakumar Majhi belongs to a poor family. He is in Yr1 in a village primary school, and lives with his parents, sister and brother in a small mud house in Kalahandi district. He is very active and likes to play cricket with his friends. Eventually he would like to become a teacher when he has finished his studies.</p>
                                <p>Nabakumar’s father is a seasonal farmer growing vegetables and rice both for food and for some income. He has a very small plot of land and he is not able to get adequate production from the land because of the traditional farming methods that he still uses. Due to the low production their income is not sufficient to feed the Nabakumar and his family. His circumstances are not conducive to good development due to poor hygiene conditions, lack of clean drinking water and sanitation facilities at home. There is no electricity to his house.</p>
                                <p>Through our program, his father will be encouraged to join a village farmers group and he will be assisted with seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural equipment. He will be trained in technical and scientific farming methods to increase production from their land and improve harvests. This will also enable him to get enough income from the cash crop he sells and expand his farm. Nabakumar will be encouraged to be part of child leadership team in the village where they will be trained and equipped through character and leadership development program. They will also be trained in child safety and protection issues and be taught about child marriage, child abuse and child labour. NabaKumar’s mother will be taught health education and hygiene to keep their house clean and protect the children from falling ill.</p>
