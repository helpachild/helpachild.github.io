                                    <p>These are specific activities we choose from time to time to support. Contributors can donate as they are able and the funds will be allocated to the specific project.  <br> <br>
                                    Currently we are working on projects in urban slum areas in developing countries. We see this as a major issue for many countries as rural agricultural workers leave their villages and move to the cities searching for work. <br><br> 
                                    Typically we have a project in Kolkata, India, the objective of which is to improve the socio-economic conditions for 90% of families of targeted children in Sahib Mahal, Kamar Math slums in Kolkata Metropolitan city by 2021.</p>
