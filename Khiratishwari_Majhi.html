                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Khiratishwari Majhi belongs to a poor family and is regularly attending the early childhood centre in her village. She lives with her parents and sister in a small mud house in Kalahandi district. She is very active and likes to play with her friends. She would like to become a teacher when she finishes her studies.</p>
                                <p>Her father is a seasonal farmer who grows maize and rice both for food and for some income. He has a really small of land and he is not able to get adequate production from the land because of the traditional farming methods that he still uses. Due to the low production their income is not sufficient to feed Khiratishwari and her family. The village she lives in suffers from poor hygiene, with no clean drinking water, sanitation facilities and no electricity connection to her house.</p>
                                <p>Through our program, her father will be encouraged to join the village farmers group and he will be assisted with seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment and training in modern farming methods which will help the family manage their agricultural lands and increase their harvest. This will also enable him to get enough income from the cash crop he sells and expand his farm. Khiratishwari will be encouraged to join a child leadership team in the village where she will be trained and equipped through character and leadership development programs. She will also be taught about child safety and protection issues including child marriage, abuse and child labour. Her mother will be taught about health and hygiene to keep her house clean and tidy and stop her children from falling sick.</p>
