                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Ajay is from the village of Benskatri in Central India. <br><br>
                               
                               He is the youngest of 3 children. Ajay comes from a very poor background. His father was an alcoholic and died due to alcohol related issues. In extreme distress Ajay's mother abandoned all 3 children and has not been heard from for the past 4 years. Extreme poverty puts huge pressures on families. Ajay is one of many "kids in crisis". <br><br>
                               
                               Ajay's grandparents, who are also living in poverty, have taken on the responsibility of caring for all 3 children. They can't afford to send Ajay to school or provide for his basic needs. <br><br>
                                
                               The <strong>Help A Child Australia RESTORE </strong> program will stand by Ajay's grandparents (ie; his primary care givers) and, guided by a loving Christian counsellor, will seek to enhance his educational, physical, emotional and spiritual development. <br><br>
                               </p>

                                <!-- <p>Adity lives with his family in a semi mud house with very poor living conditions in the slum of Kolkata City. His father works as a daily wages labourer and earns very little to take care of his children. As a result of this Adity does not get enough food to eat and hence is ill most of the time. Due to a lack of awareness of the importance of education by his parents, and their poverty, he is often neglected. Adityâ€™s living conditions are very poor due to inadequate housing and disease is rampant in this unclean and unhygienic slum.</p> -->
